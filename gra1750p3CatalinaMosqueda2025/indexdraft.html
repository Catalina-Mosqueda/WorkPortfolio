It’s a meal that combines delicate rice and egg noodles, flavorful pork, shrimp, and a balanced sauce that perfectly ties all the elements together. Unlike traditional soup-based noodle dishes, Hu Tieu Mi Kho is served “dry,” meaning the noodles are tossed in sauce rather than broth, though it’s usually paired with a side of hot, aromatic broth for sips between bites.</p>
