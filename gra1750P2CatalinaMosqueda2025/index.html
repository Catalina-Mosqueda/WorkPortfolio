		<main> <h2> Vitnamese Dry Egg Noodles <img src="vietnamesedryeggnoodles.jpg" alt= "Vitnamese Dry Egg Noodles"> </h2> <p>Hủ Tiếu Mì Khô aka Vietnamese Dry Egg Noodles is a popular Vietnamese dish that combines elements of Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. It’s a meal that combines delicate rice and egg noodles, flavorful pork, shrimp, and a balanced sauce that perfectly ties all the elements together. Unlike traditional soup-based noodle dishes, Hu Tieu Mi Kho is served “dry,” meaning the noodles are tossed in sauce rather than broth, though it’s usually paired with a side of hot, aromatic broth for sips between bites.</p>
